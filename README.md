# Sujata Sahu - Data Expert
I am a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Data Science, completed through a thesis track, and bring 8 years of prior professional experience in data analysis, modeling, and pipeline development. My thesis focused on designing a neural network using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn to reduce the dimensionality of a large dataset from 2,142,510 features to 110 while capturing non-linearity. These 110 features were successfully used to predict water level surges at 12,603 locations, providing critical insights to the Natural Hazards Center and enabling more effective evacuation strategies. Additionally, I developed a Large Language Model (LLM) application to extract and analyze information from text files, significantly saving time and enhancing research efficiency.

In my past experience, I have created Tableau dashboards tailored to client requirements, defined KPIs, and automated data pipelines to optimize workflows. I also utilized advanced analytics to provide actionable insights and support informed decision-making. As a Data Analyst Intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, I successfully migrated datasets from AWS S3 to Databricks using PySpark and SQL, streamlining workflows and reducing dependency on developers. At Quadrant Resources, I developed a resume parser that reduced recruitment time by 50%.

I hold Salesforce Sales Cloud Consultant and Salesforce Administrator certifications, showcasing my ability to design and implement scalable CRM solutions, optimize workflows, and enhance user experience within the Salesforce ecosystem.

Beyond technical contributions, I have led a team of 15 members, training and mentoring associates in cutting-edge technologies while ensuring seamless project delivery.
